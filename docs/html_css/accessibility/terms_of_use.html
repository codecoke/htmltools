<h3>关于《Divo in Accessibility》：</h3>
<div class="p_begin"><strong class="p_frist">D</strong>ivoin Accessibility，它的原作者是 Mark Pilgrim，因GNU Free授权的缘故，我将它整理在这里，并修改了一部分翻译的用词--原翻译有部分很台湾腔，不通俗易懂。当然我的修改也很粗陋，欢迎您指正。</div>
<p>到今天为止，中国虽然是第2大上网人数国家，但是中文网站的亲和力设计，可以说是最差的。以几大门户为例：弹窗浏览、插件、巨长页面，等等，忽略用户感受，不照顾特殊群体……糟糕之处，数不胜数。</p>

<p>同时，我相信越来越多的人正在按亲和力原则来设计网页，google，是在网页亲和力上做的很好的商业公司之一，google的表率作用和用户口碑不言而喻。希望这些内容有助于你理解亲和力对于网页和用户的价值。
</p>
<p>
当然了，无论是否用于商业用途，您都可以随意转载和修改这部分内容，让打造亲和力网页的设计原则传播得更远。再次感谢您的阅读和关注。

<pre>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</pre>

    <h3>0. PREAMBLE</h3>

    <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute
    it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
    not being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</p>

    <p>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
    which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

    <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free
    documentation: a free program should come with manuals
    providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
    License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for
    any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
    published as a printed book. We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
    reference.</p>

    <h3>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h3>

    <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
    be distributed under the terms of this License. The &quot;Document&quot;,
    below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>

    <p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p>

    <p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to
    the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and
    contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
    subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
    legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
    regarding them.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
    Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released
    under this License.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
    specification is available to the general public, whose
    contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
    composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
    some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
    input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
    variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A
    copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup
    has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
    &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>

    <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
    modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
    proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
    and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
    output purposes only.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
    legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
    title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
    page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most
    prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</p>

    <h3>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h3>

    <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying
    this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
    copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
    those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
    obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
    enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
    section 3.</p>

    <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>

    <h3>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h3>

    <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover
    Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
    clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
    on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
    Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
    full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
    preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
    conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</p>

    <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
    fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p>

    <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
    or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent
    copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p>

    <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p>

    <h3>4. MODIFICATIONS</h3>

    <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above,
    provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely
    this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>
        <strong>A.</strong>

        Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
        title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
        previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
        listed in the History section of the Document). You may use
        the same title as a previous version if the original
        publisher of that version gives permission.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>B.</strong>

        List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons
        or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications
        in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
        principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
        authors, if it has less than five).</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>C.</strong>

        State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>D.</strong>

        Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>E.</strong>

        Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
        modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>F.</strong>

        Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
        license notice giving the public permission to use the
        Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the
        form shown in the Addendum below.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>G.</strong>

        Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
        Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the
        Document's license notice.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>H.</strong>

        Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>I.</strong>

        Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title,
        and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
        authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
        the Title Page. If there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot;
        in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
        authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
        Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>J.</strong>

        Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
        Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the
        Document, and likewise the network locations given in the
        Document for previous versions it was based on. These may
        be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network
        location for a work that was published at least four years
        before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
        the version it refers to gives permission.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>K.</strong>

        In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or
        &quot;Dedications&quot;, preserve the section's title, and preserve
        in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
        contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
        therein.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>L.</strong>

        Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section
        numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
        section titles.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>M.</strong>

        Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a
        section may not be included in the Modified Version.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
        <strong>N.</strong>

        Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot; or
        to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do
    this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
    Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be
    distinct from any other section titles.</p>

    <p>You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the
    authoritative definition of a standard.</p>

    <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
    the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
    Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
    may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
    entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
    the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
    another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old
    one.</p>

    <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity
    for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified
    Version.</p>

    <h3>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h3>

    <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above
    for modified versions, provided that you include in the
    combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the
    original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
    Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</p>

    <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be
    replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant
    Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
    title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it,
    in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
    that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same
    adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
    Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>

    <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one
    section entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections
    entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections entitled
    &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections entitled
    &quot;Endorsements.&quot;</p>

    <h3>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h3>

    <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with
    a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that
    you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of
    each of the documents in all other respects.</p>

    <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p>

    <h3>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h3>

    <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
    of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count
    as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is
    called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not
    themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>

    <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within
    the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the
    whole aggregate.</p>

    <h3>8. TRANSLATION</h3>

    <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
    section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
    requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
    you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
    in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
    Sections. You may include a translation of this License
    provided that you also include the original English version of
    this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation
    and the original English version of this License, the original
    English version will prevail.</p>

    <h3>9. TERMINATION</h3>

    <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.
    Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their
    licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p>

    <h3>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h3>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to
    time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
    present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p>

    <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number. If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies
    to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that specified version or of any later
    version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever
    published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <h3>How to use this License for your documents</h3>

    <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>
<blockquote><p><tt>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
      Free Documentation License&quot;.
</tt></p></blockquote>

    <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write &quot;with no Invariant
    Sections&quot; instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you
    have no Front-Cover Texts, write &quot;no Front-Cover Texts&quot; instead
    of &quot;Front-Cover Texts being LIST&quot;; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p>

    <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under
    your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General
    Public License, to permit their use in free software.</p>
